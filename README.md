# Customer-Shopping-Behavior-Analysis
I built a Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis project where I cleaned retail data in Python, stored it in PostgreSQL, and used SQL to analyze spending patterns, discounts, product ratings, shipping preferences, and customer segments like new and loyal buyers to derive actionable business insights.

The project follows a complete data workflow: cleaning → storing → analyzing → interpreting.

## What I Built  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation  
Using Python, I:  
- Handled missing and inconsistent values  
- Standardized columns for reliable analysis  
- Created new features such as:  
  - Age groups  
  - Purchase frequency  
  - Customer segments (new, returning, loyal)  

### 🗄️ Database Design  
I loaded the cleaned dataset into **PostgreSQL**, structuring it so it could be queried efficiently for real business questions.

### 📊 Business Analysis with SQL  
Through SQL, I investigated questions like:  
- Who spends more = subscribers or non-subscribers?  
- How do discounts affect buying behavior?  
- Which products get the best ratings?  
- Which shipping method do customers prefer?  
- Which customer group brings the most revenue?

## Key Insights  
Some patterns that stood out:  
- Loyal customers generated the highest revenue.  
- Discounts significantly boosted purchase likelihood.  
- Certain product categories consistently outperformed others.  
- Shipping preferences differed across customer types.

## Tools Used  
- Python (pandas, numpy)  
- PostgreSQL  
- SQL  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Why This Project Matters  
This wasn’t just about coding. It was about understanding people through data and using that understanding to support smarter business decisions. It helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, database handling, and translating data into real insights.
